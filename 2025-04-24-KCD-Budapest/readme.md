# KCD Budapest (24-04-2025)

These are all the files used for the KCD Budapest talk about k9s.

To view the presentation, install [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides) and call it with `slides slides.md`.

All additional logic is in `Taskfile.yaml`, a taskfile to be used with [task](https://taskfile.dev/)

Thanks,
Erwin
